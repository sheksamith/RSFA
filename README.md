# READ SMS FROM ANDROID

RSFA (Read Sms From Android) is an Android app built with Kotlin that reads all incoming SMS messages and immediately sends them to a Firebase Realtime Server. This app is not intended for personal use, but rather for developers who want to integrate SMS messaging functionality into their own apps.

It is important to use this app responsibly and with the appropriate permissions from the users. Reading someone else's SMS messages without their consent is a violation of their privacy and can be illegal. The app is designed to demonstrate how to read and send SMS messages in Kotlin, but it should not be used for unethical purposes.
